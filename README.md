Task 1 : CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Problem Statement: Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

Approach: 

1. Preprocessed and normalized the transaction data, handled class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Trained and evaluated classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forest and decision tree to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

Insights:

Dataset was imbalanced as instances of fradulent transations were much less than valid ones.

From above evaluations we can say that the Random forest model perfoms the best with accuracu score of 94.01% among all.



Task 2 :  MOVIE RATING PREDICTION

Problem Statement: Built a model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors, using regression techniques.

Approach: 

1.Explored and preprocessed historical IMDB movie data, including feature engineering.

2.Leveraged regression techniques to develop predictive models.

3.Evaluated model performance to ensure accurate estimation of movie ratings.

Insights:

Explored factors influencing movie ratings, uncovering valuable insights for the industry.

Developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating movie ratings, contributing to better decision-making in the entertainment sector.

Random Forest Regression model seems to perform the best among the three models, as it has the lowest MAE and MSE, and the highest R2 score.


Task 3 - SALES PREDICTION

 In this project, I delved into the realm of sales forecasting using machine learning techniques in Python.

Problem Statement: Developed a model to predict product sales, considering factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

Approach:

1.Analyzed and preprocessed sales data, including feature engineering to extract relevant insights.

2.Utilized machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

3.Evaluated the model's performance to ensure accurate sales predictions.  

Insights:

Explored the impact of advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection on product sales.

There is a linear relationship between TV and Sales

Developed a robust predictive model, enabling businesses to optimize advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

Linear Regression performs the best as it has lowest Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error but highest R-squared among all other models.
